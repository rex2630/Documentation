To render a translation containing HTML tags using pipe, you must set the translated value via the `innerHTML` attribute of the wrapping component.

Consider a translation `hello_peter` with the English value `Hello <b>Peter</b>!`

This way, it renders the HTML tags.
```html
<div [innerHTML]="'hello_peter' | translate"></div>
```

For `t` component, the attribute `isHtml` does the trick.
```html
<div t key="hello_peter" [isHtml]="true"></div>
```

## Security
The HTML is automatically sanitized for both `t` component and `translate` pipe. However, if you don't expect HTML
input in your code, it's always not to provide the strings using innerHtml.

```
<b onmouseover=alert('XSS testing!')>Hello Peter!</b>
```

This is sanitized to: `<b>Hello Peter!</b>`
